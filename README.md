Align &amp; Distribute tools for Maya's node editor

Graphing nodes in Maya's node editor is less than unpredictable. Often time, I would rearrange the graph to my liking, only to have maya destroy it. These are the first steps towards making the node manager less crazy, and having a finer level of control over what gets moved, when and to where.

TODO:

-sort/graph by node inputs, and array attr indices on selected nodes

**Not fully ready to release the source yet, but this could use some testing.
