**this is not a serious tool, I wrote this hungover on a Saturday. Please request autodesk to make something better for Maya. 

Graphing nodes in Maya's node editor is less than unpredictable. Often time, I would rearrange the graph to my liking, only to have maya destroy it. These are the first steps towards making the node manager less crazy, and having a finer level of control over what gets moved, when and to where.

TODO: sort/graph by node inputs, and array attr indices on selected nodes

**Currently only supports the first tab in a node editor

**Not fully ready to release the source yet, but this could use some testing. So you probably shouldnt use it at all, lol.

TO USE:

import nodeAlignDeezUI

nodeAlignDeezUI.run()
